## Ideas

### multiple modes ?
im thinking to maybe implement multiple modes (like vim, but more):
* delete mode
* replace mode (search&replace functionalities)
* insert mode
* normal mode (moving the cursor)
* move mode (* moving rows or words)

just an idea, maybe some of these are a bad idea. must test this out when editing with it.
